                    This paper traces the evolution of culture and respect for the earth through human history from the hunter and gatherer era to the industrial revolution down into modern times. It looks at the degrading value placed on caring for the earth and the consequences of this action, especially amongst the most vulnerable groups in society. It also forecasts social issues such as migration, quality of life and climate apartheid. It goes ahead to propose possible solutions that have to be put in place to mitigate further degradation.

        <strong>1. Introduction </strong> <br>
        Despite the earth being home to millions of species only one dominates. This specie has become more deadly than volcano 
        eruptions, shifting tectonic plates, wildfires or floods and is the greatest menace threatening to wipe out life within its 
        few centuries of modernization. Humans have evolved over the millenniums to showcase their ingenuity, resourcefulness, 
        adaptability and innovation but their way of life is killing the only place they call home.
        </p>
        Man’s relationship with the planet is still evolving. Prehistoric records show man’s disposition was one of awe at the creative 
        and destructive power of nature. He showcased these sentimental feelings through religion and art where the planet was portrayed
         as an alcove of creation. These initial feelings led many cultures across the world to refer to the planet as a loving mother, 
         that is “Mother Earth”, who caters to the needs of all creation. It fostered respect, a need to protect her and the resources 
         she provides in order to maintain the delicate balance of nature. Over the centuries, there was a gradual shift from a hunter
          and gatherer society to agrarian settlements that exploded into cities as the human population grew. Man became dependent on 
          the comforts of urban living while gradually severing the direct link with nature as he developed commerce and economy that 
          fuelled the drive for profit and meeting the ever-growing consumer demand.
        
        <p>

        The rise of the middle class and social trends catalysed innovations in production processes which ushered in the industrial 
        revolution that began in the late 18th century in textile mills in the United Kingdom. This milestone in human history helped
         nations develop their technologies faster to meet the needs of their expanding population but it also brought along its own 
         set of problems. Huge energy needs led industries to burn up coal, natural gas and petroleum at increasing rates to satisfy a 
         growing global consumerism culture. These have added to the release of significant amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases 
         into the atmosphere; they contributed to increased global temperatures and effectively ushered us into the Anthropocene 
         epoch.<sub>1</sub>
        </p>   
        
        <p>
        Fast forward a few generations later to the 21st century and not much has changed as we have become a race totally dependent on
         fossil fuels. In our rather brief history of modernization, we seem bent on exhausting all available resources within our 
         reach including energy sources that have taken millions of years to form.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>2. Effects of our choices</strong> 
        <br>
        The earth is in constant flux; its climate is changing, the continents are moving, species gradually die out and others dominate.
         The climate change cycle is a natural phenomenon the earth undergoes every couple thousands of years. There are significant 
         archaeological evidence pointing to several ice ages over the last 650,000 years that have contributed to migrations and changes 
         in the biosphere.<sub>2</sub> So why the worry? The exponential rate of change is not giving lifeforms, including humans, 
         enough time to adapt as the ecosystem is thrown into upheaval initiating a rapid species extinction. It has been throrised that some great empires like the Khmers and Akkadians have had the reigns of their empires cut short by overpopulation, mass migration and 
         overexploitation. Their activities magnified the stress on the environment which contributed to strains on their resources 
         leading to adverse changes in their microclimate which helped initiate the decline of their civilisations.<sub>3</sub>
            
        <p>
        Similar changes to the biosphere are negatively affecting the earth's carrying capacity. Extreme weather patterns are affecting 
        ocean and land temperatures which are consequently affecting fish, flora and wildlife thereby increasing the risk of uncertainty 
        in communities that live off the land. Besides the physical discomfort one experiences from the heatwaves, studies have linked 
        climate change to the spread of diseases. Warmer temperatures make the environment more habitable for microbes, parasites and 
        disease vectors. It allows them spread to regions where they were previously non-natives.<sub>4</sub> With the right conditions in 
        place, a breakdown in infrastructure caused by a single catastrophic regional event can send shockwaves of infections around the 
        globe creating a pandemic that could wipe out millions of lives.
        </p>    
        <img class="all" src="images/Amazon.jpg" width="1000" alt="Arial view of Amazon forest"/>

        <p>Mining and clearing the Amazon Forest for farming is rapidly depleting one of the largest carbon storages on the planet and 
            releasing tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere daily. At the current rate of deforestation we will likely see the ecosystem destroyed 
            and become a savannah within a few decades. Additionally, booming birth rates means an increase in travel, energy needs and 
            consumerism all of which are heavily dependent on petroleum or its by product. So far, we have turned to technology to help us 
            manage but not solve these problems. It is still unclear how well our current technology will be able to withstand these global 
            erratic changes or if they will be nearly as effective in the future.</p>
        
        <strong>3. The outcomes</strong>
        <br>

        The slow encroaching nature of climate change makes it very deadly. Unfortunately, humans have a track record of not dealing with 
        issues until it is too late as governments politely ignore warnings from scientists and consumers enjoy pushing blames unto 
        corporations. Our way of life is completely unsustainable and poses an existential threat. With the world population boldly 
        marching towards the 8 billion mark the pressure placed on the planet’s carrying capacity continues to increase. The demand for food,
         water, land and energy will continue to increase as a consequence of the current rate of leisurely interest in the innovation of 
         clean energy. We are going to see an explosion in CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation that will worsen an already terrible situation.
        
        <p>
         Within our lifetime we will witness changes to the world as we know it. A study by Sukhdev (2011) puts the cost of damages 
        and losses to the ecosystem by the top 3,000 companies in the world at $2.2tn per annum<sub>5</sub>. These losses affect biodiversity,
         ecosystems and lifestyle around the world, especially among poor and indigenous people groups who contribute least to this 
         phenomenon<sub>6</sub>. It is expected to bring exacerbating economic, climatic and social changes to every facet of life. Societies 
         directly dependent on the existing conditions of their microcosm for survival will have their source of livelihood stripped bare 
         and left unable to cater for themselves. This debt of destruction has been accumulating for decades and eventually someone is going 
         to have to pay for it, that someone is going to be us.
        </p>

        <p>
        A United Nation (UN) report by Alston (2019) estimates that about 120 million people will be pushed into poverty by 2030 as a 
        result of climate related issues<sub>7</sub>. Drought, flooding and food shortages are already creating millions of climate 
        migrants at the hardest hit regions in the horn of Africa and island nations who are adding to the already frightening number of
         displaced persons. Islands inhabitants on the Isle de Jean Charles, Nararo and Nuatambu have been forced to make a choice between 
         moving or dying as their homes are gradually swallowed up by rising sea levels.<sub>8</sub> Lost access to ancestral sites and 
         forced migration disrupts the way of life they have known for centuries and creates a sense of lost identity. Poorer nations 
         devastated by erratic weather conditions are finding it increasingly difficult to cater to their populace forcing droves of 
         of people to move to other regions to survive. The growing number of displaced persons is mounting pressure on resources available 
         to organisations like the UN who are already stretched thin as it is.
        </p>

        <p>
        <img src="images/flood.png" width="300" style="float: right; margin-right: 10px" />
        In the near future it is likely “haven regions” least affected by these changes will become more militarized to protect their borders, 
        stretch out resources and check climate migrants. In due course, it will become increasingly difficult to uphold moral ideals that 
        have built up human societies with the most vulnerable group i.e., women and children, bearing the brunt of this fallout. These 
        conditions encourage climate apartheid. Expect to see governments suspend human rights as they occasionally resort to extreme and 
        sometimes unethical control measures to cull population influx.
        </p>

        <p>
            It will widen the inequality gap because the rich will pay to avoid hunger, conflicts, diseases and overheated regions while the 
            rest of the world is left to fend for itself. We got a preview during the 2012 Hurricane Sandy flooding where the Goldman Sachs 
            building in New York was protected by sandbags and had electricity from its generator while most New Yorkers, even hospitals were 
            left in the dark. Likewise, there has been a rise in private firefighters being dispatched to mansions of clients with high 
            premiums to protect their houses from wildfires while the poor watch their houses being gulped up by flames<sub>9</sub>. Rapidly 
            deteriorating environmental conditions will leave poor affected communities with very little options: migration or death. 
            Unfortunately, the uncertainty and fear that results from such displacements lead to an explosion of racist and xenophobic attacks. 
            Human rights and democracy will not survive the coming disruption instead it will unravel the progress the UN and other 
            international agencies have made over the last 70 years.
        </p>

        <strong>4. A way out</strong>
        <br>
        Increased protests demanding action on climate change is helping to draw attention to the issue. However, the unfortunate truth 
        is that, even if all emissions were stopped today it will not drive down global temperatures overnight as we have already 
        set into motion conditions to ensure increased global temperatures for at least the next 10 years . Consumers and corporations 
        have roles to play in this fight. The pressure of posting quarterly gains makes most companies intentionally oblivious to the 
        disastrous effects of their production processes as they chase profits to satisfy investors. Society has to modify its 
        definition of success and place a demand on firms compelling them to compete on innovation and sustainable production rather 
        than extreme profit margins. Companies have to be incentivised to pursue sustainable innovation in ways that preserve the 
        environment and satisfy consumer demand.

        <p>
        It is time we start scrutinizing our choices. Consumers must take personal responsibility to educate themselves on B corporate 
        brands that uphold sustainable production so they can support them. This will encourage more research in sustainability. 
        Increased sale will drive up the profits of such firms and push more funds into research for better sustainable innovations. 
        We must change our lifestyles and choose more sustainable options that help the environment. For example, buying only items we 
        need or buying only food we will eat to cut down on waste.
        </p>

        <p>
        Aerosol injections, carbon capture and carbon storage are a temporary relief and not solutions to the problem. Cutting down the 
        Amazon and other forests around the world to increase arable land is not a smart move as almost 50% of all food produced on the 
        planet is wasted<sub>10</sub>. Investing in better food processing technology that covers all production stages from farm to table to 
        cut down on these losses is a viable alternative because it reduces the need for more land. Population control is a rather sensitive
         but important issue. The planet can only support so many people before its limit is breached. There are just not enough resources 
         to satisfy the needs of the growing population. Governments all over the world must intensify education on birth control, resources
          utilisation, population and its effects on the planet. Conversely, forced birth restriction are an outright violation of rights and must never be seen as an options. Hisory has shown us that instituted (disclosed or undisclosed) birth control polices have all ended up harming families and the mental health of their victims.
        </p>

        <p>
        Governments and think tanks need to come up with working models of solutions to climate change challenges and not merely having 
        yearly symposiums to discuss ideas or propose solutions that are never implemented. The drive to combat climate change is a hidden 
        opportunity for governments and international agencies to invest in the lives of the poor, especially those of the most vulnerable 
        groups and protect their rights. It should be seen as an opportunity for governments to work on poverty eradication and security as 
        they design and implement policies to tackle these concerns. This challenge should be seen as the catalyst that could ignite the 
        5<sup>th</sup> industrial revolution and better the world we live in.
        </p>

        <strong> 5. Conclusion</strong>
        <br>       

        Unlike the Akkadian and Khmers, we have a foreknowledge on the causes and consequences of our actions. We have the capacity to do 
        something and must take steps to do so now. It is time we hold ourselves and our governments responsible for elusive climate change 
        policies. Advocating an immediate global law to ban all carbon-based energy is unrealistic because our world will almost come to a 
        standstill. However, incentivising sustainable energy research and education on the facts associated with climate change will 
        produce a better outcome.
