<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
<em>
    Mobile phones have gone from luxury items to daily essentials in the lives of billions of people around the world. The start-up boom encouraged the creation of numerous apps targeting specific market niches and in the last decade, they have become more sophisticated offering thousands of streamlined services. With the touch of a button, they are able to grant end-users access to various resources in different sectors, including agriculture. This paper evaluates the stance of mobile agricultural apps in sub-Saharan Africa. It gives a brief history on their development and points out why they have been a successful farm improvement tool in subsistence agriculture. It also identifies possible challenges that may stifle their applicability and growth potential in the region. It then goes ahead to highlight possible ways to mitigate these challenges.

    <h3><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>
    Agriculture is undergoing a revolution all over the world. A move propelled by governments, individuals and investors who want to 
    be at the forefront of this long-awaited leap. The focus on climate change not only puts pressure on the sector to reduce its 
    carbon emissions, but also come up with avenues to absorb some of the greenhouse gasses already expelled into the atmosphere. In 
    recent years, smart farming and the concept of responsible innovation have become necessary tools for sustainable intensification 
    (Rose & Chilvers, 2018). And as we approach the cusp of the fourth agricultural revolution, countries the world over are 
    strategically placing themselves in a position to ride this wave in order to achieve maximum returns (Lejon & Frankelius, 2015). 
    The revolution in Africa is moving on a rather different path. Unlike their counterparts in developed nations, changes in Africa 
    are moving at a slower pace, but are having a more profound effect on society than would be expected.<p></p>

    The survival of millions in Africa is dependent on agriculture, as the continent contains
    about 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land – in addition to abundant natural
    resources. The sector informally employs over 175 million people who produce staple
    crops, cash crops, meat, hide, timber and other raw materials, a large portion of which are
    consumed locally. One would therefore expect a highly advanced and diversified industry
    with investors begging farmers and agro-allied industries to take their money for a share of
    the profits, but this is not the case. Despite the seeming abundance, Africa is actually the
    most food-insecure region in the world, with a large percentage of cultivated land in the
    sub-Saharan region owned by subsistence farmers who grow staple crops, and a few who
    grow cash crops and herd animals on fragmented plots that have become too small to be
    economically viable (Austin, Ulunma, & Sulaiman, 2012). Crude farming implements,
    archaic production practices, non-existent distribution networks and high production losses
    have also worked hand-in-hand to keep farmers in a perpetual cycle of uncertainty and
    poverty. The growing middle class and rapid urbanisation have led to the migration of
    youths from rural farming areas to cities in search of corporate jobs. The consequence is a
    disinterest in agriculture that is reinforced by difficulties surrounding land acquisition,
    decaying infrastructure and the increasing costs of farm inputs, all of which have become
    huge deterrents for entry into the sector<p></p>

    <h3><strong>REVIEW</strong> </h3>
    The survival of millions in Africa is dependent on agriculture, as the continent contains about 60% of the 
    world’s uncultivated arable land – in addition to abundant natural resources. The sector informally employs 
    over 175 million people who produce staple crops, cash crops, meat, hide, timber and other raw materials, a large portion 
    of which are consumed locally. One would therefore expect a highly advanced and diversified industry with investors begging 
    farmers and agro-allied industries to take their money for a share of the profits -but this is not the case. Despite the seeming 
    abundance, Africa is actually the most food-insecure region in the world, with a large percentage of cultivated land in the 
    sub-Saharan region owned by subsistence farmers who grow staple crops, and a few who grow cash crops and herd animals on 
    fragmented plots that have become too small to be economically viable (Austin, Ulunma, & Sulaiman, 2012). Crude farming 
    implements, archaic production practices, non-existent distribution networks and high production losses have also worked 
    hand-in-hand to keep farmers in a perpetual cycle of uncertainty and poverty. The growing middle class and rapid urbanisation 
    have led to the migration of youths from rural farming areas to cities in search of corporate jobs. The consequence is a 
    disinterest in agriculture that is reinforced by difficulties surrounding land acquisition, decaying infrastructure and the 
    increasing costs of farm inputs, all of which have become huge deterrents for entry into the sector.<p></p>

    Decades after independence, farming has declined to become one of the most disdained professions on the continent. The rich and 
    middle class consider agriculture to be the ultimate sign of poverty and forbid their children to consider careers within the 
    sector (Nir, 2019). Farming has become relegated to poor villages whose only reason for existence is to supplement food imports
     in towns and cities. An unspoken understanding has developed between the classes, and most would prefer to maintain the status 
     quo. These attitudes go beyond stereotypes; they have subconsciously flowed into national policies, including funding to the 
     agricultural industry and agriculture departments in universities, which have affected the development of the sector on the 
     continent.

    <H4><strong>Africa must feed herself</strong> </H4>
    By 2035, Africa’s population is expected to explode to 1.8 billion. Governments will be presented with new sets of challenges in
     healthcare, education, infrastructure and agriculture as 50% of this demographic is expected to be below 24 years 
     (Bello-Schünemann, Cilliers, Donnenfeld, Aucoin, & Porter, 2018). Low agricultural productivity and heavy reliance on imports 
     creates a security and social risk not just for African countries but for other nations as well. One bad harvest could expel 
     millions of ‘hunger migrants’ fleeing starvation to nations across the world, thereby increasing pressure on NGOs and host 
     countries already quivering from existing numbers of refugees.

     Climate change is also affecting the field outputs of large exporting countries like the US, leading to an erratic supply of the 
     imported staples such as rice, wheat, soybean and maize on which sub-Saharan nations have come to depend. Any decrease in supply 
     drives up food prices, which pushes these food items out of the reach of the poor. Simply put, overdependence on food imports is 
     risky because food prices on the global market fluctuate. As determined by FAO (2009), poor households already spend a large 
     proportion of their income on food and high prices resulting from the volatility of on International Commodity Markets can push 
     them further into poverty, as was evident in the 2007–2008 world food crisis. This overdependence has contributed, in part, to the 
     underdevelopment of local production industries.

     <p></p>

    <h4><strong>Looking for change</strong></h4>
    There is evidently a need to modernise the agricultural sector to raise the output and income levels of farmers to attract young 
    talents. The plan is to use the interface between agriculture and technology to attract the younger generation who have an unending 
    fascination with innovation. Moves like this have been met with some level of scepticism, as many believe the myth that 
    mechanisation will lead to increased unemployment because less labour will be needed for manual work. On the contrary, 
    mechanisation will lead to an increase in agriculture-related jobs such as transportation, processing, packaging and research, 
    which will absorb the floating manpower from subsistence farming.

<p></p>

    So far, individuals and governments have looked to funding from developed nations whenever technology or development is mentioned. 
    Africa has become dependent on development aid from other continents to prop up its industries and supplement national budgets. As 
    it is becoming increasingly evident that dependence on foreign aid does not help developing countries – especially those in 
    Africa – better their industries, some nations are starting to come up with other solutions. At the eighth CGECI meeting in 2019, 
    President Paul Kagame of Rwanda encouraged African countries to finance their own transformation by partnering with neighbouring 
    nations and private entities. He also deprecated overdependence on foreign aid and encouraged dissemination of knowledge among 
    partners (Mwai, 2019).<p></p>

    Billions of dollars in foreign aid have flowed into Africa and have been relatively ineffective in producing any tangible change 
    over the decades – notably within the agricultural sector. Even so, some academics and NGO reports attribute what little 
    improvements that can be observed as a direct result of their instituted programmes. In line with Pedroza’s (2012) findings, 
    these claims are inconclusive as humanitarian agencies lack the systemic means to evaluate the effectiveness of their programmes 
    properly. One can equally argue these changes are a result of the fall in extreme global poverty rates (Roser, 2019) caused by 
    improved international trade and lower production costs, which have created wealth and made the world richer. Mass production and 
    improving technology have made previously exclusive items and services trickle down to the poor.

    <strong><h4>The groundwork</h4></strong>
    The advent of mobile phones has been met with wide acceptance and rapid adoption. Mobile phones have created an avenue for 
    low-income individuals to partake in the global technological revolution. The falling cost of mobile devices, thanks to low 
    production costs in countries like China, is making these devices affordable to almost everyone. The infrastructural challenges in 
    Africa have led many start-ups to develop their business ideas around the most readily accessible technology – mobile phones. They 
    have become the platform for numerous digital services beyond social media or traditional call services and offer a way for 
    low-income individuals, including farmers, to keep up with technological progress<p></p>

    This revolution started with mobile money transfer services, which laid the foundation for other extra-mobile services. M-Pesa, 
    launched by Vodafone in Kenya in 2007, was the forerunner, but its business model has now spread to other African countries. 
    The growth of telecommunication infrastructure has provided an avenue for small businesses and individuals to avoid the high costs 
    associated with money transfers by using pay-as-you go mobile services that exclude traditional bank charges or account maintenance 
    fees. Such services also exceed the speed and security of the traditional system of having to wait until someone from the city was 
    going to the village to send money back to one’s family. As noted by Pasti (2018), sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 45.6% of global 
    mobile transactions, with an estimated value of US$26.8 billion (over 28% of the global total) in 2018.<p></p>

    The growth of telecommunications in Africa is helping to push the continent’s agricultural revolution forward. In 1999, with the 
    exception of South Africa, most sub-Saharan countries had low mobile coverage or barely functioning landline networks, but by 2008 
    over 60% had access to mobile services (Aker & Mbiti, 2010). Unlike the gradual move from landlines to mobile services experienced 
    in developed nations, Africa’s transition was quite sudden, and it is still evolving. For example, there has been a move from SIM 
    cards and phone ownership being couple-owned or group-owned to being individually owned. In addition, the dropping costs of these 
    services has increased accessibility to SMS and the Internet (James, 2018). It is estimated that about 75% of African own a phone 
    (Hetland, 2016) and have access to the Internet, so they are able to look up information of interest to them or at the very least 
    receive pictures and SMS from family members. The spread of mobile phone ownership has also helped connect city dwellers with 
    families in villages and hard-to-reach places. In less than 10 years, mobile phones have gone from luxury devices to almost basic 
    necessities in many countries.

    <strong><h4>Breaking the mould</h4></strong>
    As developed economies slow down and struggle to maintain positive GDPs, global investors look towards emerging economies for new 
    opportunities. Individuals from emerging economies are also becoming aware of investment opportunities in their home countries and 
    are turning their attention inwards. A growing number of young technopreneurs throughout Africa are beginning to see investment 
    opportunities in the agritech sector. Many of them are graduates, some from well respected US and Europe institutions, who have 
    quit their jobs to move back to Africa or were discontent with work conditions in their respective countries and decided to become 
    self-employed. Most have come in from non-agricultural backgrounds to pursue what many believe to be one of the most undervalued 
    investment opportunities on the continent. Additionally, besides a steady income stream, this sector not only addresses the need 
    for food, but also has a lasting positive social impact.<p></p>

    This renewed interest seems to be the push the industry has been waiting for. Local farmers are surprised but happy to see educated 
    youths coming back into villages to document their experiences and improve on them. Current farmers see themselves as custodians of 
    the land and are beginning to accept the fact that they must be more open to change if they are to become competitive – either that,
     or be pushed off the scene. So far, both generations have been able to work together to develop much-needed apps and informative 
     material based on methods and data provided by the older generation. The older generation, impressed by the usability of such apps,
      are becoming more willing to incorporate the offered services into their daily farm tasks, because they were created specifically 
      to address issues within their localities.

.<p></p>

    A few popular examples of such apps include Farmcrowdy and EZ Farming. These are Nigerian digital crowdfunding platforms working to 
    connect investors across the world to thousands of local farmers across Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. With as little as US$200, 
    investors can become patrons to farmers in return for a share of the profits at the end of a farming cycle. Farmers sign up to these
     platforms to access finances, inputs, labour and information needed to ensure a bountiful harvest. Their progress is monitored and 
     the funds released in stages throughout the growing season. These companies have also established relationships with export 
     partners in developed nations who buy farm produce at fair prices. The end game is to help farmers earn enough profit to become 
     independent, improve their lives and reinvest some of their own profits to grow their farms. Kitovu is another Nigerian start-up 
     making soil analysis available to farmers at affordable rates on their mobile phones. It also helps farmers access agro-chemicals 
     and seeds (Jackson, 2019).<p></p>

     Zenvus (a Nigerian start-up) and the Kenyan companies Apollo Agriculture and Tulaa are providing inputs, advisory services and 
     market connections to small- and medium-scale farmers. Their goal is to maximise output by incorporating satellite data and 
     machine learning. Their customised services range from finance to produce marketing, and all these services can be accessed on a 
     mobile phone (Balachandran, 2018). UjuziKilimo is another Kenyan interactive advice-sharing, machine-learning platform where 
     farmers can get advice on weather, soil or farming activities.<p></p>

     National governments are also actively participating in this technological revolution. The Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation 
     Agency (2019), for example, has developed a digital soil map accessible to everyone by phone. This takes the guesswork out of 
     determining farm soil types or plant needs. The Nigerian government works with over 15 million small-scale farmers through an 
     e-Wallet programme, providing mobile services tailored to individual farm needs. Similarly, Wefarm is a peer-to-peer mobile 
     information service operating in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Farmers give and receive information by SMS, cutting out the need 
     for the Internet. Cowtribe, in Ghana, provides veterinary services ranging from outbreak reports to vaccination reminders.<p></p>

    <h3><strong>FINDINGS</strong></h3>
    Familiarity with already existing mobile financial services has made farmers more willing to try other innovations rolled out on 
    the same platform. Mobile phones have become the gadget of choice for most people. One can have one’s bank, TV, communication 
    device, torch, alarm clock and radio all on a single device. When one adds portability and price to the list of attributes, mobile 
    phones become an almost indispensable item that many in rural communities simply refuse to live without.<p></p>

    One has to bear in mind that, in the case of rural farms, access to the internet does not necessarily mean access to much-needed 
    information, as most online data on innovative approaches to farming are geared towards intensive industrial farms in developed 
    nations. They have little or no applicability to small-scale farmers looking to gain a little information on how to increase 
    output, either because of their high cost or complicated nature. Low literacy rates in Africa also mean that farmers will prefer 
    apps that are straightforward and easy to use or those on which they can see pictures, figures and illustrations (Gyamfi, 2005).

    <h4><strong>Why farming applications work</strong></h4>
    Despite the myriad of information available on the Internet, such information is yet to be of any tangible benefit to the life of 
    the average farmers in Africa. The millions spent on online databases and information centres are ineffective because they are not 
    accessed by the target audience. Instead, they are being used by large farms, multinational agricultural conglomerate and 
    academics. Most mobile farm apps, meanwhile, are user-friendly so they do not require organised lessons or extensive training 
    sessions.<p></p>

    NGOs are a dime a dozen in Africa and have come to be seen as part of everyday life. Farmers have come to expect such organisations 
    to invite them for trainings or information sessions. These organisations are perceived as public-private partnerships that exist 
    as a matter of course, rather than out of a determination to effect changes. This is why although farmers volunteer for trials, 
    they sometime opt out midway, and those that stay until the end are just too polite to leave so they finish the programme cycle 
    and continue with their previous farming practices. Although NGOs report high success rates, it should be noted that those results 
    tend to focus more on the rate of adoption of new techniques, but hardly give any information on how long adoptees continued with 
    the methodology in question. It is also important to note that the transmission of information and acknowledgement of receipt does
     not necessarily mean a desire to implement or a clear understanding of the science behind results.<p></p>

     On the contrary, because farmers decide to use these apps without being cajoled into doing so, they put in time learning all they 
     can about how these apps work. Another distinct advantage is that these tools help to reduce ‘noise’ in communications. 
     They eliminate the unnecessary information that usually accompany other transmission channels such as group trainings or 
     demonstration plots by focusing in on the desired information.

    <h4><strong>Challenges opposing the move</strong></h4>
    It is not news that the Green Revolution and other self-sufficiency strategies have failed in Africa due to improper policy 
    formulation, implementation structures and socio-cultural differences across each region. They failed to consider the differences 
    in soil types and that irrigation technology was not as widespread on the continent as in Asia. Additionally, the success of such
     moves do not depend on the government alone, but on the people and the private sector (Voortman, 2013).<p></p>

    Additionally, it has been difficult to maintain the success of implemented programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. New projects receive 
    much media attention and the surrounding enthusiasm makes participants try their best, but the desire to continue dwindles during 
    the project lifespan … almost vanishing towards the end. There is a need to maintain momentum if the desired end results are to be 
    achieved. Additionally, most governments, individuals, the private sector and NGOs do not build on the groundwork laid by their 
    predecessors. They prefer to start afresh or rebrand existing projects, which takes away from the direction and impact already 
    achieved. It is sometimes necessary to build projects from the ground up, but in most cases, this has not been the best use of 
    resources. A chain of continuity has to be established to enforce the impact of achieved results. The best course of action is not 
    to abolish or roll out new programmes that conflict with already existing plans on the ground.<p></p>

    It is possible that farmers might become dependent on some of these apps, such as Farmcrowdy and Tulaa, without desiring to become 
    self-reliant – in much the same way African countries have become dependent on foreign aid. Because these services are becoming 
    more available, the desire to outgrow the dependence on these software may gradually fade, giving farmers no reason to want to 
    improve beyond their assistance. One may suggest that a limit be placed on the number of times each farmer can access such 
    applications or give them permission to use these platforms for only a certain number of years, after which they are expected to be 
    self-reliant. This is not feasible, because farmers can just move to other platforms and keep receiving the same type of support 
    elsewhere. As there is also competition between technopreneurs – with each trying to amass as many users as possible – it is not 
    likely that they will turn down prospective users for the sake of enforcing a login limit. It is also possible that some farmers 
    may be slower than others and will not become self-sufficient before any determined deadline, so rules like this will push them 
    back into poverty. Climate change is already affecting weather pattern across Africa and causing unpredictable rainfall and floods. 
    According to Cooper and colleagues (2008), these conditions are expected to worsen over time, so access to information and quick 
    response times are essential if farmers are to be able to feed their families. The challenge is bridging the gap between technology 
    and agriculture in a way that builds on its existing success while gradually pushing farmers towards self-sufficiency.<p></p>

    Good governance is key to the development of industries in any nation. Most app creators are first-time entrepreneurs, who launch 
    into the scene unprepared for what they encounter. Like most start-ups, the failure rates are very high so having conducive local 
    conditions in place that support businesses are beneficial to agri-tech platforms, especially if they plan to be pan-African or 
    globally competitive. So far, successful projects have not only required partnership with investors and innovators that understand 
    the African terrain but have also taken the initiative to customise their products to the culture and needs of each country. 
    Investors and international NGOs are key players in agricultural development but many have lagged behind start-ups because they 
    still hold onto unrealistic or outdated work plans that are more in line with academic theories than reality. To partner with these 
    platforms adequately, they need to re-evaluate their approach if the intent is to tackle the root cause of drawbacks in agriculture 
    and put funds to better use.<p></p>

    <h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>
    One thing we can be sure of is that the agricultural revolution in Africa will not follow the same evolutionary stages as those on 
    other continents. In today’s modern world, it may be impossible to have that same gradual shift from subsistence to mechanised 
    farming. Rather, it will follow a different path, a hybrid approach that blends modern technology with everyday field operations at 
    a pace convenient for local farmers. A push for a quicker move to enable the continent ‘catch up’ would only produce similar 
    failures to those seen in previous agricultural movements. It would be best to let this trend develop organically and not stifle it 
    by trying to ensure the revolution follows the same paths as those in Asia or Western nations. It will be interesting to follow its 
    advancement and watch the growth of this new facet of agricultural development..<p></p>
